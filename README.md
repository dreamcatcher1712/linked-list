LINKED LIST:
A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node. Address of the first node is HEAD. The last node in the linked list can be identified because its next portion points to NULL. 
CURSOR BASED IMPLEMENTATION:
used when linked list are required but pointers are not available.
